Security aspects of banknotes have to be reconsidered constantly and security features have to be improved to take effective measures against counterfeiters. In this paper, we introduce a novel authentication concept for security prints. We use a specialized form of the redundant FastWavelet Transform to gain and analyze the spectral components of banknote representations. By evaluating the high-frequency coeffcients, we calculate appropriate features that contain characteristics of the selected patterns and allow for class discrimination. We found that use of statistical features is appropriate when analyzing banknotes. The calculated features were fed into a classiffer that successfully determined the authenticity of supplied banknotes.
